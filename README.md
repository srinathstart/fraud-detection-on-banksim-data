# Fraud Detection with Machine Learning On Banksim Data

Fraudulent behavior can be seen across many different fields such as e-commerce, healthcare, payment and banking systems. Fraud costs businesses millions of dollars each year. 

Automated detection of fraudulent behavior can be done in various ways including rule based approaches and machine learning.
This repository uses the latter approach for classification of fraudulent transactions. 

For the in-depth analysis you can check out my notebook on Kaggle below or run the ipynb file in your Juptyter environment.

The synthetically generated dataset consists of payments from various customers made in different time periods and with different amounts. If you want more information on the dataset you can refer below to the Dataset title for the dataset link and information and you can find the original paper for the dataset under the "Original Paper" title. 

For those who do not wish to run the script to acquire the results, here is a quick recap of the classification results of the machine learning models used in the script:

!Update Note: These results are without the oversampling technique SMOTE. I have also added a jupyter notebook with more insights and used the SMOTE for balancing the dataset. Overall results looks more better just check the file called Fraud Detection on Bank Payments.ipynb from inside the repo.
